=======

Parse utilities for iso8601 encoding.

Whereas encoding is offered by `datetime.isoformat()
<http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.isoformat>`_,
the standard library offers no means to decode an iso8601 format
datetime into a `datetime
<http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime>`_
object.  This module just makes up for that deficiency in an
unobtrusive way.

Synopsis
--------
::

   import iso8601
   dt = iso8601.parse_datetime("1994-11-05T08:15:30-05:00")

Description
-----------

parse_datetime(string)
   Parse an iso8601-encoded datetime string.

   Args:
      string: an iso8601 datetime string.

   Returns:
      A `datetime
      <http://docs.python.org/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime>`_ object.
   Raises:
      ValueError: Could not parse the provided string.

ISO8601_RE
   Regular expression for an iso8601 encoded date, to be used for
   validation or manual parsing.

Installation
------------

To install iso8601, make sure you have Python 2.7 or greater
installed. Then run this command from the command prompt:

    python setup.py install

If you're upgrading from a previous version, you need to remove it
first.

Though it is not a requirement, it is highly suggested that you have
`Distribute <http://packages.python.org/distribute>`_ installed.
